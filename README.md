# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-
Credit Card Fraud Detection through Machine Learning Classification 
## Dataset - Kaggle
## Models trained -
  1. Logistic Regression
  2. Decision Tree
  3. Random Forrest
Amongst these three Random Forrest is the best Model.
As dataset is highly imbalanced because lack of fraud data rows present in it. I have used balancing techniques like "OverSampling" and "UnderSanpling" and trained all three models on both dataset.
# OverSampling : 
                w.r.t project, no. of valid transaction data rows and fraud transaction data rows are matched by generating fraud transaction data rows which matches the no. of valid transaction data rows.
# UnderSampling :
                 w.r.t project, no. of valid transaction data rows and fraud transaction data rows are matched by randomly choosing that many data rows as fraud transaction data rows present in dataset.
